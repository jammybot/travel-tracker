# Travel-Tracker
This is a learning experience for me to get used to coding in JS enviroments and doing a full pipeline build trying to automate everything if possible.

# How To
Clone project
cd travel-tracker
node . or node index.js -- starts the express server and intialises the database. 

You are now ready to use the api.

Open a browser and check if the server is running http://localhost:3000/api/status

Check all the trips that I have been on http://localhost:3000/api/trips
